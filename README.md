## Learning Algorithms

This repository is for which algoritms I learned.


## Folder Structure

- `src`: There are `Main.java`, and `Algoritms` package.
- `Main.java`: It is a driver class to show the result of sorting arrays by using sorting methods.
- `Algorithms`: There are some classes for soritng algoritms. Each class name represents what kind of sorting algoritm it is.


Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.
